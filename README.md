Alticci Sequence Calculator (Backend) ‚öõÔ∏è
</h1>
<br>

## üí¨ About the repository

The Alticci Sequence Calculator calculates an Alticci sequence value based on a passed index, which is defined as follows:
n=0 => a(0) = 0

n=1 => a(1) = 1

n=2 => a(2) = 1

n>2 => a(n) = a(n-3) + a(n-2)

The core service takes advantage of past calculations to speed up future calculations through caching (using memoization). In addition to the main service, there is also a service by Spring Cache, to demonstrate the performance difference when memoization is not used.
